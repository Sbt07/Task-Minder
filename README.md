# Task-Minder

A basic to-do list maker web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows you to add and manage your to-do tasks with ease.

## Features

- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task.
- Delete tasks by clicking on the "x" icon.
- Tasks are stored locally in your browser's localStorage.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the to-do list maker.

## How it works

- The `inputBox` element allows you to add tasks by pressing Enter after typing a task.
- Tasks are displayed in a list within the `listContainer`.
- You can mark a task as completed by clicking on it. Completed tasks are visually highlighted.
- To remove a task, click on the "x" icon next to the task.
- The application stores your tasks in your browser's `localStorage` so you can revisit your to-do list later.
